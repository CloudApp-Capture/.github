## About CloudApp Capture
CloudApp Capture is a visual communication tool designed to streamline how teams share information and provide feedback. It turns complex explanations into simple, consumable visual moments. By combining robust screen capture capabilities with instant cloud sharing, it eliminates the friction of saving files locally, uploading to a separate service, and distributing links. Whether you need to report a bug with a quick screen recording, give design feedback with annotated screenshots, or create a GIF to demonstrate a micro-interaction, CloudApp Capture makes the process fast and seamless.

The platform is built for workplace collaboration. Shared links open to clean, professional pages where viewers can watch videos, view images, or download files. For team accounts, features like view tracking, password protection, and custom branding (using your own domain for links) are available. The integration ecosystem connects CloudApp with popular workplace tools like Slack, Jira, Trello, and Salesforce, allowing you to paste a CloudApp link directly into a conversation or ticket for instant context. This focus on reducing steps and improving clarity makes it an essential productivity tool for customer support, software development, design teams, and remote workers who rely on visual communication.
